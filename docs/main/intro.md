**Nuclear Sunset** (NS) is a complete overhaul of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3, with over 1400 mods focused on modernizing, expanding, rebalancing, and enhancing all aspects of both Wastelands. Designed for a hardcore gameplay experience, NS draws significant inspiration from acclaimed survival-horror titles like STALKER and Resident Evil. While remaining current with emerging content, every addition is carefully evaluated, customized, and seamlessly integrated with an emphasis on stability, performance, and balance. We consider UF to be the most visually impressive, innovative, comprehensive, well-balanced, and cohesive Tale of Two Wastelands experience available. Enjoy!

:::important What sets Nuclear Sunset apart?
- NS is created and maintained by capable and well-known mod authors, which is reflected in trouble shooting, bug fixes, and NS-exclusive additions.
- NS is a community-driven project, enriched by contributions from some of the community’s most talented and knowledgeable figures, whose expertise and insights have been invaluable.
- NS has access to cutting-edge mods, often available even prior to their official release. In fact, many unique mods are also created exclusively for NS.
- NS includes ample custom edits to existing content to promote cohesion and enhance the player experience, such as adjustments to objects, NPCs, quests, scripts, meshes, textures, navmeshes, collision markers, and roombounds.
- NS has been rigorously optimized, with custom enhancements not otherwise found in the modding community. Every mod asset has been evaluated and, when appropriate, reprocessed, downsized, compressed, mipmapped, and BSA-packed. Large new additions are thoroughly memory tested prior to inclusion to prevent degradation in performance as the list continues to evolve. Scripts are profiled and evaluated for potential performance implications as well.
